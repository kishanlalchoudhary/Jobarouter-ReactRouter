# Jobarouter - React Router

This is a simple project aimed to show the use of the React Router v6 library, which is a JavaScript library used in React applications to manage client and server-side routing.

## Features

- used createBrowserRouter, createRoutesFromElements, Route, RouterProvider and Outlet components to create a client-side routing system with nested routes
- used Navlink and Link components to connect the various pages and parts of the website
- Custom 404 Page
- used loader prop and useLoaderData Hook to load data asynchronously
- used useParams hook to access the parameters of the current URL, such as a dynamic ID in a route
- used errorElement prop to specify the element that should be rendered when an error is caught by the ErrorBoundary
- used useLocation Hook for implementation of Breadcrumbs to allow users to simply browse back to previous parts
- used Form component and action prop for handling form submissions
- used Navigate component and useNavigate Hook to redirect the user based on certain conditions
